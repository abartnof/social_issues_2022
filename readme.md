# Public Polling in the 2022 Midterm Election Season
Andrew Bartnof, Spring 2022

## Background problem
In light of Justice Alito's 
[leaked draft opinion](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504) 
regarding the repeal of Roe v Wade, the 2022 midterm season looks like it will focus more on group inclusion/exclusion and civil rights than any other election season in recent memory.
But is a series of referendums on Democratic or Republican politicians truly a good proxy to deal with these issues? 
Or is this as absurd an exercise in voting between two beautiful dogs in order to resolve the issue of world hunger?

## Hypothesis
If the 2022 elections are to mean anything in a logical way, then we should be able to tie Americans to the two-party system in a coherent way; and we should be able to tie Americans, as broken-out by these two parties, to pragmatic solutions to our civic issues in a coherent way.

In other words:
- We talk a fair amount about the various coalitions that exist within the Republican and Democratic parties; does it even make sense to describe us in terms of these two groups?
- And even if it _is_ accurate to describe most Americans as belonging to one of these two oppositional groups along one metric (loosely, conservative v liberal, although even that dimension is beginning to fray), do these groups actually disagree on what they want from their governments?

## Methods
Here I analyze data from a recent [American National Election Studies](https://electionstudies.org/about-us/) public research dataset in order to answer these questions.
- If ideological convictions break evenly into one dimension with two parties, then if we dump the ANES' respondents' ideological convictions into a factor analysis, we should find that only one latent variable (Republican/Democratic) shakes out.
- If the two-party system is a valid representation of our convictions, then it should be predictive of the policies that we endorse, and we should find that members of the two parties disagree on current issues.
